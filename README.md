# Fruit Detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and TensorFlow

## Overview

This project is a fruit image classification application built using **TensorFlow** and **Streamlit**. It leverages a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to detect and classify fruit images into multiple categories. The web interface is built using Streamlit, allowing users to upload an image and see which fruit is detected.

### Features

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: A CNN architecture designed to classify fruit images.
- **Multiple Fruit Classes**: The model classifies images into various fruit categories.
- **Dropout Layers**: Used to reduce overfitting and improve model generalization.
- **Customizable Image Shape**: The input image size is customizable using `image_dataset_from_directory`.
- **Streamlit Integration**: A user-friendly interface where users can upload an image and receive predictions.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Python**: Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- **TensorFlow**: Install TensorFlow using the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install tensorflow

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Python**: Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.

### Streamlit

Install Streamlit to build and run the web app.

### Other Libraries

Install necessary dependencies such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and OpenCV.

## How to Run the Application

To start the Streamlit application, navigate to the directory where the `app.py` file is located and run the application.

The app will launch a local server, and you can interact with the fruit detection model by uploading images through the web interface.
